     Problem: Defense of a Kingdom (Greedy)

    There is a kingdom represented by a grid of width 'w' and height 'h'.
    Some towers are placed on certain grid coordinates. Each tower defends
    its entire row and column (like a queen in chess). All other cells 
    are unprotected.

    You are to find the **maximum unprotected rectangular area** on the grid.

    ðŸ“¥ Input:
      - w: width of the grid (columns)
      - h: height of the grid (rows)
      - towers: list of (x, y) coordinates where towers are located

    ðŸ“¤ Output:
      - Maximum rectangular area on the grid which is not protected by any tower

     Approach:
      - Extract all tower x and y coordinates
      - Sort them to calculate the maximum gap between adjacent towers
      - Consider edges of the grid as well
      - Final answer = max horizontal gap Ã— max vertical gap

     Time Complexity: O(n log n)  // due to sorting
     Space Complexity: O(n)      // storing tower coordinates
